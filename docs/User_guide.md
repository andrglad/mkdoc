This guide is primarily intended for users who have the following roles in Maverix: Security Engineer and Manager.
  
Before users with the above roles can start using Maverix, it should be integrated with the required set of software tools and properly configured by a user with the role of Administrator. This guide describes the system operation under the assumption that Administrator has already completed all necessary steps described in the [IS Administrator](../SAG/IS_Admin_Guide.htm)&nbsp;and [Application Administrator Guides](../AAG/Application_Administrator_Guide.htm).
